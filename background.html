    The following sediments highlight key themes needing to be addressed:
  </p>

  <p>
   “We appreciate the basic things done well... making sure that we get our breaks, 
    that we have access to hot food in our department. 
    Simple things like that are actually really important...
    I don’t think that putting on meditation or resilience training 
    are necessarily the best way to help and support staff. 
    I think that making them feel like their basic needs are helped and they are valued, 
    are probably the most important things” (Billings et al., 2021).
  </p>

  <p>
  “The Thursday night clap was always very, really like, angering and made us just so frustrated… 
    made us feel like “ok, so you think that will be enough for us? 
  Don’t give us safe working conditions and hazard pay”, but instead, 
    they brought in this idea of heroes, like militarizing the whole response, 
  like our death would be seen as a sacrifice rather than absolutely due to inadequate response 
    from the employer, from the government. That made us so angry” (Billings et al., 2021).
  </p>
  <p>
   “I think firstly, there needs to be a way of recognising it because everyone has been so involved 
    that it has been hard to recognise that people are falling apart,
  one of the people went off with an acute psychotic episode and actually in retrospect 
  we should have picked that up earlier and one of my other colleagues 
    has gone off with very bad depression in the last week and the signs were there 
  but it’s a matter of how you try and spot that” (Billings et al., 2021).
  </p>
  <p>
    “One day as I worked in the makeshift ICU, one of the hospital’s leaders went floor to floor making an important delivery. 
  She approached our nursing station in her crisp professional attire and fresh disposition, 
    and proudly delivered a supply of makeup-removing wipes. 
  She told us to use the wipes to clean our faces before putting on our N95 masks so we could reuse the masks later, 
  then moved on to the next nurses’ station without asking how our staff was doing or if we needed anything. 
  I wonder if she had noticed the nurse crying in the supply closet” 
    (“I’m a Nurse in a Covid-19 Unit. My Hospital’s Leaders Frighten Me More than the Virus,” 2020).
  </p>
  <p>
    “The problem with healthcare is that mental health is slightly stigmatized in healthcare workers 
    and people don’t want to admit that there is a problem… 
  they stress a culture of resilience and I don’t think anyone wants to be seen as being unable to cope with anything” (Billings et al., 2021).
  </p>
<p> 
  Heroic narratives were unhelpful and were in contradiction to the professionalism of health and social care roles, 
  detracted from debates about pay and protection, and at worst, created a barrier to staff seeking support. 
  After all, heroes do not struggle; angels do not get PTSD (Billings et al., 2021).

  Lateral violence is a serious occupational health concern among nurses 
  as evidenced by extensive research and literature available on the topic. 
  Lateral violence is a form of bullying grounded in the theoretical framework of the oppression theory. 
  The bullying behaviors occur among members of an oppressed group as a result of feeling powerless and having a perceived lack of control in their workplace. 
  The ten most common forms of lateral violence among nurses are 
  non-verbal innuendo, verbal affront, undermining activities, withholding information, 
  sabotage, infighting, scape-goating, backstabbing, failure to respect privacy, and broken confidences (Botha et al., 2015).
  </p>
<p>
  The attention to what is needed for the current pandemic HCW has been everywhere but focused on the actual well-being of the worker. 
  I pulled three key themes for synthesis which are 
  psychological consequences of the pandemic, occupational factors and interventions, and the theory of implementing resilience programs and training.
