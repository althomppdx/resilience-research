I I will be taking a meta-ethnography approach to data collected from articles containing studies, trials, and articles 
    of interventions provided to HCWs and the psychological consequences experienced by HCWs. 
    I will compile data from multiple sources to highlight new insights into healthcare professionals’ experiences and perspectives. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    The synthesis of information can provide important theoretical and conceptual ideas 
    and generate supportive evidence for healthcare practice and policy. 
    The hypothesis is that resilience interventions that have the underlying promotion of mindfulness, 
    are not appropriate for psychological traumatic stress dealt with during the pandemic and the occupational ecosystem 
    of the hospital system contributed to the mass exodus of HCWs. 
    This synthesis will be important for reflection to administrative hospital personnel, as well as governing bodies when 
    looking towards the future to properly implement programs that will support and address mental health needs. 
The current compilation of  articles cover data in the form of trials, surveys, interviews, questionnaires 
    that refer back to psychological frameworks of emotional intelligence, Trauma Screening Questionnaire, 
    Maslach Burnout Inventory, Posttraumatic Growth Inventory short form, Perceived Stress Scale, 
    Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale, Effort Reward Imbalance, and 
    Lazarus’ Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, and Compassion Fatigue Model. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Procedure & Analysis
  </p>
Following a meta-ethnography framework:
Identifying an area of interest- I have identified that phenomenon of psychological implication of COVID on healthcare workers. There is a large body of research noting a higher rate of psychological issues are being reported and minimal concepts to address this. The framework of intervention that is implemented has not been proven to work in the traumatic stress setting currently. 
Inclusion/exclusion of relevant studies- The next stage I would take my current studies and use one of the quality assessment tools such as CASP or JBI-QARI. I am looking for data from the United States on HCWs as well as the effectiveness of resiliency. 
The total of the 25 articles have been found. The account for data from the three key concepts totalling: 
Psychological consequences of the pandemic 91,524 participants and 92 studies, trials, and articles
Occupational factors and interventions- 2,249 participants
Resilience programs and training- 66 trials, articles, research
  </p>
<p>
Synthesis of material
</p>
<p>
After the articles have been assessed and I have included and excluded articles that do not include United States, HCWs, and resiliency I would look for key concepts and metaphors. My identified key concepts and metaphors of focus are:
First person code contained themes of call to duty, first person needs, hero complex, and shoulder the burden. 
Mental health code group contained awareness and stigma
Occupational burnout contained depression, job stress, traumatic stress, lateral violence, stress management, burnout, bullying, and isolation
Training code included  leadership, resilience training programs, mindfulness, intervention, and support. 
  </p>
<p>
Correlation of material
  </p>
<p>
I used the quantitative data software Atlas.ti to identify themes, support or criticism of interventions, and statistical data of value from studies. I used interviews, testimonies, and trials to translate lived experiences into theoretical and conceptual themes. I determined from the codes that the meaningful concepts that developed were psychological consequences of the pandemic, occupational factors and interventions, and the theory of implementing resilience programs and training. I also identified key terms of relevance:
Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program- mindfulness was originally defined by Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979 as “paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally, to the unfolding of experience moment to moment.” MBSR programs are designed to be educationally based programs that focus on training in the contemplative practice of mindfulness with the goal to empower individuals to respond to situations consciously rather than automatically (Botha et al., 2015).
Compassion fatigue- a state of emotional exhaustion due to the dynamics of a caring relationship with an individual or a group of individuals who have suffered a sudden or severe loss (Labrague & de Los Santos, 2021).
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that occur at any point following a traumatic event or a threatening one which involves affective, behavioral, cognitive, physiologic and relational symptoms as well as dissociative symptoms and traumatic flashbacks and impair normal functioning (Skramlik, n.d.).

  Translating materials into one another
  </p>
<p>
  I will use the materials to find the commonality between them. One commonality I have found is the lack of psychological resources and accessibility to HCWs and the cultural views of stigma regarding mental health in the conceptual term “shouldering the burden.”
Synthesizing the translations- One commonality I have found is the lack of psychological resources and accessibility to HCWs and the cultural views of stigma regarding mental health in the conceptual term “shouldering the burden.”
