How my proposed research would lead to a significant improvement, and how it would benefit the field.

  <p>
 psychological consequences of the pandemic
  </p>
<p>
    The fear and anxiety caused by an infectious disease can be devastating if not appropriately identified and managed. 
    Due to the sudden outbreak of the disease, we do not know what nurses experience when caring for patients with COVID-19, 
    especially during the situation where nurses are sent away from their usual work environments to work in the epicenter (Zhang et al., 2020). 
    “Now is the time that people are developing some of the problems. At the time when everybody was immersed and working, 
    there were a few people developing problems, but actually I think that the PTSD and the after effects are coming now.” 
    The societal culture of the hero complex allowed for the concepts of call to duty and shouldering the burden of stigmatizing seeking supportive services. 
    “There are posters in changing rooms and things, saying like ‘if you need someone to talk to...’ 
    and there are the named people who have put themselves forward for if you want to talk to them, but you almost feel like they are in this job as well 
    and I’m going to come to them with something they are doing as well and it’s hard, you almost feel like I don’t want to bother them with a problem 
    when they are going through it as well” (Billings et al., 2021).

  <p>
   occupational factors and interventions
  </p>
  <p>
    There are three main effects of stress on nurses: 
    burnout, depression and lateral violence. Burnout has been defined as a syndrome of depersonalization, 
    emotional exhaustion, and a sense of low personal accomplishment, and the occurrence of burnout has been closely linked to perceived stress. 
    Researchers reported that nurses who experienced a higher degree of job stress were 80% more likely to have suffered 
    a major depressive episode in the previous year.In a study conducted in Pennsylvania, researchers found that while 43% of the nurses who reported high levels 
    of burnout indicated their intent to leave their current position, only 11% of nurses who were not burned out intended to leave in the following 12 months.
    9 In the same study patient-to-nurse ratios were significantly associated with emotional exhaustion and burnout. 
    An increase of one patient per nurse assignment to a hospital’s staffing level increased burnout by 23% (Botha et al., 2015). 
    When seeking opportunities to engage in existing coping strategies where possible many HCWs commented on not having been able to take time off work 
    or use annual leave during the pandemic and several acknowledged increasing alcohol consumption in the absence of other mechanisms 
    to relieve stress (Billings et al., 2021).

<p>
  the theory of implementing resilience programs and training
</p>  
<p>
    There remains a lack of clarity related to what critically defines a resiliency training program. 
    Programs are operationalized in diverse ways and lack a common theoretical or scientific specificity. 
    The field also lacks a consistent approach to measurement and it is often unclear whether outcomes chosen are sufficiently specific to the intervention. 
    Some studies have been structured to address the type of stress they wished to mitigate, 
    for example programs intending to impact trauma-induced stress (i.e. as might occur in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder 
    after a major catastrophe or tragic event) were very different in terms of approach used and outcomes evaluated from those intending to impact more generalized,
    everyday stresses (Leppin et al., 2014).
