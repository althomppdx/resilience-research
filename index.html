      Has the US failed nurses in reslience training during COVID & have they failed each other with worklife culture?

   The United States is experiencing a mass exodus of healthcare workers. The social coverage in the media and statements from governing bodies have been calling out and blaming COVID fatigue or compassion fatigue as the cause. 
    COVID fatigue is described as physical and mental tiredness, may occur during a pandemic as a consequence of the interruptions in the usual routines and activities of an individual due to various measures implemented to decrease virus transmission (e.g. lockdown, quarantine, social distancing) (Labrague, 2021). 
    Healthcare workers, including staff that directly work with COVID patients, have become acutely vulnerable to developing mental and psychological issues.

  <p>
    There has been higher reporting in rates of anxiety, emotional exhaustion, depression, mental distress, fatigue, and post-traumatic stress disorder (Labrague, 2021). 
    Pyschological issues was previously reported that nearly 40% of HCWs 
    experienced significant major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or posttraumatic stress symptoms, while others found 
    that 1 in 5 resident physicians contemplated suicide or self-harm in the wake of the initial COVID-19 surge (Peccoralo et al., 2022). 
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly, compassion fatigue is a state of emotional exhaustion due to the dynamics of a caring relationship with an individual or a group of individuals 
    who have suffered a sudden or severe loss. Compassion fatigue often occurs as a consequence of persistent exposure 
    to patients' suffering, stressful work conditions, and inadequate utilization of measures to promote self-care (Labrague & de los Santos, 2021).
  </p>

  <p>
    In an effort to address the compounding fatigue 
    hospital leaders, public health agencies, and governments 
    have invested heavily into programs with the theoretical framework of resilience support and training.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Resilience, or an individual's ability to rebound from traumatic or highly stressful events has been recognized as an important protective factor against various mental and psychological stressors (Labrague & de los Santos, 2021). 
    These programs are a loosely defined group of interventions that systematically seek to enhance resilience in individuals or groups. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For the greater clinical knowledge, no single accepted theoretical framework or consensus statement exists to guide the development or application of these programs.
    Furthermore, despite international use and testing, there remains little clarity related to 
    what is fundamentally required for a program to be considered resiliency training, 
    let alone for it to be considered effective (Leppin et al., 2014).

  <p>
    “People have tried to take up these interventions, but they haven’t managed to actually get through to anybody” (Billings et al., 2021) 
    or “I tried to find a therapist—I spent hours and hours and a lot of therapists are not taking additional clients. 
    I feel like a lot of the initiatives to build resilience are not for us—
    like they are not going to pay you to step away from patient care for self-care like these initiatives for those who work from home”
