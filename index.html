    Lauren Paul and her husband spent all of last week cancelling their
    honeymoon. “We were devastated until we realized how dangerous not
    cancelling would have been for all of the hospitality workers we would
    have depended on.” Lauren reported. Not one to dwell on life’s curve
    balls, Lauren and Jose decided to bring a little Provence into their
    home. “We had already done so much research on the food, the farming
    culture, the way people care for the land in Provence. We thought, why
    not spend a day pretending we’re there.”

    If you’re anything like us here at Lost In Place, your much needed alone
    time (or family/roomate/coworker pile-on) has turned to much needed
    social time. But hanging out indoors and widening our circles of
    exposure is irresponsible at best. But with warmer weather, comes a
    lovely solution: the picnic. So we have outlined everything you need to
    meet up, be safe, and mangia.

    Connection is one of the most vital aspects of human life. Not just
    entertainment, we need to form emotional attachments to survive.

    When you’re commuting to a 9-to-5, you long for the weekends, the beach
    and the get-things-done, life-organizing staycation. Our current
    environment has turned life on its head, and now more than ever we dream
    of being anywhere but at home. Until a quick trip to a new locale is an
    option, we’ve got everything you need to get away at home.

    My mother spoke Spanish with us at home from birth, through our
    disdainful teenage years, and on every phone call until the day she
    passed. When I was a youngster without the perspective that comes with
    experience, I asked her why she was so dedicated to us being bilingual.
    The simple answer, “If you and your sister do not know Spanish, you
    cannot teach it to your children.”

    Our Look Up Column is normally dedicated to the different ways travel
    gets you out of your digital dungeon, and into a new way of experiencing
    life. Since our writers and photographers are at home for the
    foreseeable future, Look Up will now dedicate space to finding that same
    feeling in the sky. Each week a writer and a photographer will team up
    to show and tell how the sky has changed in their city, and how the act
    of slowing down and giving attention to something so simple has carried
    over into life.
